I’m a software engineer working in extended reality and artificial intelligence, with a BSc in Computing and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence underway.

My projects explore how systems learn, perceive, and adapt — from computer vision and intelligent agents to applied machine learning in medical imaging, lifestyle analysis, and the computational study of intelligence.

## Projects

- [Rule-Based Chatbot Comparison](https://github.com/John-JonSteyn/RuleBasedChatbotComparison) – comparative study of programming languages through the development of rule-based chatbots, evaluating syntax, performance, scalability, and maintainability.  
- [Brain Tumor MRI Classification](https://github.com/John-JonSteyn/BrainTumorMRIScikitLearnClassification) – applying machine learning with scikit-learn to classify medical imaging datasets.  
- [Lifestyle and Sleep Pattern Analysis](https://github.com/John-JonSteyn/LifestyleAndSleepPatternAnalysis) – data analysis using pandas to study correlations between lifestyle factors and sleep patterns.  
- [Search Algorithm Comparison](https://github.com/John-JonSteyn/SearchAlgorithmComparisson) – implementation and analysis of different search algorithms, with a focus on efficiency and scalability.
