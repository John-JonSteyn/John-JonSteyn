## Who Am I

I’m a Software Engineer working in extended reality and artificial intelligence. My projects range from intelligent agents, computer vision systems, and data-driven applications to research in search algorithms, rule-based chatbots, and machine learning on datasets such as medical imaging and sleep patterns.

With a BSc in Computing and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence underway, my work is less about building systems for their own sake and more about how they can serve human attention, memory, and presence. The focus is on refining technology to meet practical needs while considering its wider ethical and social implications.

Alongside engineering and research, I mentor interns on independent projects and lead a study group of more than 70 peers, creating spaces for shared learning and collaborative growth.

This GitHub is one part of that process. I’m also active on the platforms above, where I share reflections and resources when time allows. If any of this connects with your work or interests, feel free to reach out — I’m always open to meaningful dialogue and collaborative curiosity.

## Selected Projects

- [Search Algorithm Comparison](https://github.com/John-JonSteyn/SearchAlgorithmComparisson) – implementation and analysis of different search algorithms, with a focus on efficiency and scalability.  
- [Brain Tumor MRI Classification](https://github.com/John-JonSteyn/BrainTumorMRIScikitLearnClassification) – applying machine learning with scikit-learn to classify medical imaging datasets.  
- [Lifestyle and Sleep Pattern Analysis](https://github.com/John-JonSteyn/LifestyleAndSleepPatternAnalysis) – data analysis using pandas to study correlations between lifestyle factors and sleep patterns.  
- [Rule-Based Chatbot Comparison](https://github.com/John-JonSteyn/RuleBasedChatbotComparison) – comparative study of programming languages through the development of rule-based chatbots, evaluating syntax, performance, scalability, and maintainability.
