## Who Am I

I’m a Software Engineer focused on Augmented and Virtual Reality, with a Bachelor of Science in Computing and a passion for building educational simulations that are immersive, intelligent, and human-centred.

My undergraduate degree was completed entirely online, often without direct academic support. That experience—both isolating and deeply formative—taught me to navigate complexity independently, but it also instilled in me a lasting commitment to helping others through their own academic journeys. It’s part of why I mentor interns, run a small study group, and try to share what I learn wherever I can.

I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Essex. While I’ve not yet chosen a research focus, my core interest lies in Cognitive Computing—particularly in how technology and intelligent systems might enhance the way we think, learn, and grow.

This GitHub isn't always busy, but I tend to be more active on the platforms linked above, where I share thoughts and resources in a more conversational format, when time and clarity permit.

If any part of this resonates, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to meaningful dialogue and collaborative curiosity.
