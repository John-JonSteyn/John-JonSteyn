## Who Am I

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computing and am currently employed as a Software Engineer, specialising in Augmented and Virtual Reality for a company focused on Education Simulations.

My degree was undertaken remotely, which often meant there was no direct access to lecturers. This made it our responsibility to uncover and understand the material, while also providing the opportunity to teach and support peers. Like many others, I too had to balance my academic pursuits with my professional commitments by the end of my studies. At times profoundly difficult, yet always rewarding.

I received valuable support and insights that played a key role in helping me obtain my degree. In that vein, I aim to share resources and offer insights, hoping they can make your learning journey just a bit smoother.
