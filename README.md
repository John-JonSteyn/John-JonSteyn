## Who Am I

I’m a Software Engineer working in extended reality — the intersection of digital systems and embodied experience. But for me, the goal has never been to build technology for its own sake. What matters is how these tools shape us — how they support human growth, attention, memory, and presence, or in some cases, quietly erode them.

With a Bachelor of Science in Computing and a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence currently underway, I’m committed to understanding not just how intelligent systems function, but how they interact with the human mind — and how they might meaningfully complement it.

My own academic path began online, often without direct guidance or structure. That experience formed in me both resilience and a quiet conviction: people thrive not in isolation, but in relationship and shared curiosity. It’s why I mentor interns, host a study group, and share insights when I can — not because I have all the answers, but because I believe learning should be collaborative, transparent, and human.

This GitHub is a small part of that journey. I’m more active on the platforms above, where I post reflections and resources when time and clarity allow.

If any of this resonates, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to meaningful dialogue and collaborative curiosity.
